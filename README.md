Sdcb.SparkDesk is an unofficial open-source project that provides a .NET client for the SparkDesk API(https://console.xfyun.cn/services/cbm). 

It can be used to build chatbots and virtual assistants that can communicate with users in natural language.

## Features

- Provides a .NET client for the SparkDesk API
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication
- Implements streaming APIs for real-time communication
- Provides a simple and intuitive API for chatbot development

## Installation

`Sdcb.SparkDesk` can be installed using NuGet. To install the package, run the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```
Install-Package Sdcb.SparkDesk
```

## Usage

To use Sdcb.SparkDesk, you need to create an instance of the `SparkDeskClient` class. You can create the client by passing your SparkDesk API credentials to the constructor:

```csharp
SparkDeskClient client = new SparkDeskClient(appId, apiKey, apiSecret);
```

### Example 1: Chatting with a virtual assistant

The following example shows how to use the `ChatAsync` method to chat with a virtual assistant:

```csharp
SparkDeskClient client = CreateSparkDeskClient();
ChatResponse response = await client.ChatAsync(new ChatMessage[] 
{
    ChatMessage.FromUser("Hello"),
    ChatMessage.FromAssistant("Hi there! How can I help you today?"),
    ChatMessage.FromUser("I need some help with my account"),
    ChatMessage.FromAssistant("Sure thing! What's your account number?"),
    ChatMessage.FromUser("123456"),
});
Console.WriteLine(response.Text);
```

### Example 2: Chatting with a virtual assistant using streaming API

The following example shows how to use the `ChatAsStreamAsync` method to chat with a virtual assistant using streaming API:

```csharp
SparkDeskClient client = CreateSparkDeskClient();
await foreach (StreamedChatResponse msg in client.ChatAsStreamAsync(new ChatMessage[] { ChatMessage.FromUser("湖南的省会在哪？") }, new ChatRequestParameters
{
    ChatId = "test",
    MaxTokens = 20,
    Temperature = 0.5f,
    TopK = 4,
}))
{
    Console.WriteLine(msg);
}
```

### Example 3: Chatting with a virtual assistant using streaming API and callback

The following example shows how to use the `ChatAsStreamViaCallbackAsync` method to chat with a virtual assistant using streaming API and callback:

```csharp
SparkDeskClient client = CreateSparkDeskClient();
StringBuilder sb = new();
TokensUsage usage = await client.ChatAsStreamAsync(new ChatMessage[] 
{ 
    ChatMessage.FromUser("1+1=?"),
    ChatMessage.FromAssistant("1+1=3"),
    ChatMessage.FromUser("不对啊，请再想想？")
}, s => sb.Append(s), uid: "zhoujie");

string realResponse = sb.ToString();
Console.WriteLine(realResponse);
```
